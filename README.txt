WINDOW SCRIPT by Kerryn Spanhel

Python script to position windows around my desktop.

Add shortcuts (.lnk) to Windows Toolbar:
1. right-click on Windows Toolbar
2. select Toolbars > New Toolbar...
3. Browse to ...\WindowScript\move_window
4. Add toolbar
5. OPTIONAL - right-click on new toolbar and remove text, remove title.

Notes:
* Uses .pyw to avoid console popup.
* Initially wrote the script in PowerShell but this would always open a console 
  window and move focus from the target window.
